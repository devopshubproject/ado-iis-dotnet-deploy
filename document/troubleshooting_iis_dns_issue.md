## 1. Troubleshooting Approach for DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN

----------

### Step 1: Confirm the Issue

-   Try to access the IIS application URL from multiple devices/browsers to confirm if the issue is client-specific or global.
    
-   Use tools like `ping`, `nslookup`, or `dig` from a terminal or command prompt to check DNS resolution.

    ```
    nslookup yourapp.domain.com
    ping yourapp.domain.com
    ```
-   Expected: Domain resolves to a valid IP.
    
-   Actual: DNS resolution fails or returns no records.

### Step 2: Verify DNS Configuration

-   **DNS Records:** Verify that the domain name has valid DNS A or CNAME records pointing to the correct IP address.
    
    -   Check the DNS zone in your DNS provider portal or Azure DNS if managed there.
        
    -   Confirm TTL and propagation status if recently changed.
        
-   **DNS Zone Configuration:**
    
    -   Confirm the zone is properly delegated and authoritative for your domain.
        
    -   Check for any typos or incorrect records.
        
-   **Custom DNS Servers:**
    
    -   If using custom DNS servers (e.g., on-prem or Azure custom DNS), verify these DNS servers are reachable and correctly configured.

### Step 3: Check Local DNS Cache and Browser Cache

-   Clear local DNS cache on your client machine:

```bash
# Windows
ipconfig /flushdns

# macOS/Linux
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache
sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches  # On systemd-resolved
```
-   Clear browser cache or try incognito/private mode.

### Step 4: Verify Network Connectivity and Firewall

-   Confirm the client machine has network connectivity to the DNS server.
    
-   If behind a VPN or proxy, verify DNS forwarding and proxy DNS settings.
    
-   Check if any firewall or security group blocks DNS traffic (UDP/TCP port 53).

### Step 5: Check IIS Server Configuration

-   Confirm IIS server is running and hosting the application.
    
-   Verify the bindings in IIS Manager:
    
    -   Check hostname bindings match the requested domain.
        
    -   Confirm IP address and port bindings are correct.
        
-   Check if the IIS server is reachable by IP address directly.

### Step 6: Check Azure or Cloud Infrastructure

-   If the application is hosted in Azure or cloud:
    
    -   Validate the public IP address and DNS mappings.
        
    -   Check Azure DNS zone settings.
        
    -   Review Application Gateway, Load Balancer, or Firewall settings for DNS or routing issues.
        
    -   Verify that the public IP is correctly assigned and DNS is updated.
    
### Step 7: Diagnosing with Logs

When the DNS error is not clear or continues, checking logs can help identify the root cause. Start by capturing client-side DNS queries using tools like Wireshark to see if requests are reaching the DNS server correctly. Next, review IIS logs to confirm whether the server receives any web requests and to check for errors. Look at Windows Event Viewer for any system or application errors related to IIS or network services. If you manage your own DNS server, examine its logs for failed or misconfigured queries. For cloud setups like Azure DNS, check diagnostic logs for query failures or misconfigurations. Finally, inspect firewall or proxy logs to ensure that DNS (port 53) and HTTP(S) traffic are not being blocked.

## 2. Common Causes and Fixes

A common cause of this DNS error is incorrect or missing DNS records, so you should verify that your domain’s A or CNAME records are properly set and pointing to the right IP addresses. Sometimes, the DNS zone may not be correctly delegated or authoritative, which requires checking the NS records. Local client caches or manual hosts file entries can interfere, so flushing DNS caches and checking hosts files is important. IIS might have incorrect site bindings that don’t match the domain or IP address, so these need to be fixed. Network firewalls or security groups might block necessary DNS or web traffic ports, which must be opened. VPN or proxy servers could interfere with DNS resolution and need to be configured properly. If DNS changes were recent, propagation delays or caching could cause issues, requiring time or cache clearing. In cloud environments like Azure, misconfigured DNS zones, public IPs, or network security groups might cause resolution problems and must be reviewed. Lastly, expired or invalid SSL certificates can sometimes contribute to connectivity problems and should be renewed and correctly bound.

## 3. Summary of Troubleshooting Steps

1.  Verify issue on multiple clients and confirm DNS resolution failure.
    
2.  Check DNS records (A, CNAME) in DNS zone hosting the domain.
    
3.  Flush DNS and browser caches on the client.
    
4.  Validate network connectivity and firewall rules for DNS and HTTP.
    
5.  Check IIS site bindings for correct hostname and IP.
    
6.  Review Azure DNS zone settings and cloud networking.
    
7.  Investigate logs from client, IIS, DNS servers, and firewalls.
    
8.  Apply fixes based on root cause (DNS updates, cache clearing, firewall config, IIS binding corrections).

## 4. Additional Recommendations

-   Use public DNS diagnostic tools like [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org/) or `dig` from other networks to verify global DNS propagation.
    
-   Set up monitoring and alerting on DNS and IIS logs to detect early DNS or application issues.
    
-   Automate IIS binding validation and deployment using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools such as Terraform or ARM templates.
    
-   Document DNS and network configurations clearly for team reference.
